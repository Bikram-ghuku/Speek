# Speek.Chat

Speek is currently available for OS X (10.12 or later), Linux and Windows. Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Speek-App/Speek/releases) for the latest version and changelog.

Speek is an experimental kind of instant messaging that **doesn't trust anyone** with your identity, your contact list, or your communications.

* You can chat without exposing your identity (or IP address) to *anyone*
* Nobody can discover who your contacts are or when you talk (*metadata-free!*)
* There are no servers or operators that could be compromised, exposing your information.
* It's cross-platform and easy for non-technical users.

### How it works
Speek is a peer-to-peer instant messaging system built on the Tor Network [hidden services](https://www.torproject.org/docs/hidden-services.html.en). Your login is your hidden service address, and contacts connect to you (not an intermediate server) through Tor. The rendezvous system makes it extremely hard for anyone to learn your identity from your address.

Speek is not affiliated with or endorsed by The Tor Project.

For more information, you can [read about Tor](https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en) and [learn about Speek's design](https://github.com/Speek-App/Speek/blob/main/doc/design.md) or [protocol](https://github.com/Speek-App/Speek/blob/main/doc/protocol.md). Everything is [open-source](https://github.com/Speek-App/Speek/blob/main/LICENSE) and open to contribution.
